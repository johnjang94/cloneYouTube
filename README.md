#### Background Story

> How I approached
> <br/><br/>
> It was a few months after I started to learn JavaScript. Until this
> moment, I have created a few very simple and mini games that are
> web-based. Every small game required a bit of effort to create
> because I needed to think about its functionalities and consider how
> I am going to make them work along with the UI. As I continue my
> journey in learning JavaScript, I have reached learning about the
> use of RESTful API communication.<br/><br/>
> The concept of RESTful API communication seemed to be easy, until I
> realized that the practice was far away from understanding the
> concept. Indeed, I have struggled a few times to make the project
> work in the way I have intended. I needed to pivot the plan a few
> times because I did not have a clear plan for the data structure nor
> was it organized in a way that can be easily followed. Basically,
> this project gave me a moment to think about refactoring the
> structure (besides the code that I was writing).<br/><br/>
> Perhaps, this was the motive that I looked for more projects that
> require RESTful API communication skill. I was surfing on the web
> for hours to find good sources because many of the providers were
> mixed between paid, unpaid or under-developed.<br/><br/>

> Come to Decision
> <br/><br/>
> After surfing around the website for a while, I have decided to go
> with a few well-known websites to see if they offer open-source
> options for developers. From this process, YouTube came under my
> radar, and I thought that it was a good practice to write RESTful
> API communication by creating the mock version of YouTube.<br/><br/>
> Therefore, I have decided to do the following tasks for this
> project:<br/><br/>

> create home page
> allow users to search for videos
> allow users to view other videos (rather related or not)
