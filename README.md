            <br />
            It was a few months after I started to learn JavaScript. Until this
            moment, I have created a few very simple and mini games that are
            web-based. Every small game required a bit of effort to create
            because I needed to think about its functionalities and consider how
            I am going to make them work along with the UI. As I continue my
            journey in learning JavaScript, I have reached learning about the
            use of RESTful API communication.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2.5">
            The concept of RESTful API communication seemed to be easy, until I
            realized that the practice was far away from understanding the
            concept. Indeed, I have struggled a few times to make the project
            work in the way I have intended. I needed to pivot the plan a few
            times because I did not have a clear plan for the data structure nor
            was it organized in a way that can be easily followed. Basically,
            this project gave me a moment to think about refactoring the
            structure (besides the code that I was writing).
          </p>
          <p className="py-2.5">
            Perhaps, this was the motive that I looked for more projects that
            require RESTful API communication skill. I was surfing on the web
            for hours to find good sources because many of the providers were
            mixed between paid, unpaid or under-developed.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2.5">
            <span className="underline">Come to Decision</span>
            <br />
            After surfing around the website for a while, I have decided to go
            with a few well-known websites to see if they offer open-source
            options for developers. From this process, YouTube came under my
            radar, and I thought that it was a good practice to write RESTful
            API communication by creating the mock version of YouTube.
          </p>
          <ul>
            Therefore, I have decided to do the following tasks for this
            project:
            <br />
            <li>- create home page</li>
            <li>- allow users to search for videos</li>
            <li>
              - allow users to view related videos to the searched keywords
            </li>
            <li>
              - allow users to view related videos to the videos they have
              chosen to watch
            </li>
          </ul>
